### Hackathons

- ### Hack Jaipur 2020
  Our group's idea was to use summarization methods for an office environment. It is used to summarize meetings by
  converting speech to text. The text file is then sent to the summarizer to generate a summary. We have also built an
  optical character recognition system so that we can extract text data from PDF and convert it to a text file and this text
  file will also be fed to the summarizer
